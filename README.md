# RestaurantManagement-Django
This project is built on the Django framework, a powerful Python web framework. It consists of two core applications:

## User Authentication:
This application allows users to create accounts or log in securely. User authentication is an essential component for the restaurant management system.

## Restaurant Order Management:
At the heart of the system, this application presents the restaurant menu differently depending on the user's role.

- **Administrators:** If a user has administrative privileges, they gain access to advanced menu management features. Administrators can delete, modify, and add menu items. This includes the ability to update item details such as images, descriptions, and prices, as well as adding new items to the menu.

- **Customers:** Regular customers can view the restaurant menu and access item descriptions. They are limited to exploring the menu and learning about each dish.

This project harnesses the Django framework's capabilities to create a comprehensive restaurant management system, seamlessly handling user authentication and menu management.
